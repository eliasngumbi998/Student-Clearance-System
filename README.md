# Student-Clearance-System
A student clearance system built for schools to issue barcode to the student as a means for checking whether a student has paid or not.
The admin is responsible for creating users and students as well as managing the whole affairs of the school. Every user must log in to access the system. I am putting this here for everyone to learn for, most especially the Qrcode part.
